## Automatic diagnosis in medical images from the MedMNIST Dataset
Building a CNN to do Image Classification on the 1)Colon Pathology Dataset and the 2)Blood Cell Dataset.
Taking advantage of the similarity between the datasets, two models are built for the Blood Cell Dataset. One that uses transfer learning from the previously trained colon pathology model and one that doesn't.
